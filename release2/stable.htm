        Stable coins are a special type of cryptocurrency that acts as digital US dollars, which means that the price is of stable coin is pegged to the value of a dollar. 
        These coins are used as replacements for fiat currencies like USD in order to facilitate easier transactions when trading crypto on exchanges. 
        This can be useful for frequent traders because it eliminates the need to move around actual currency that require time and additional fees. 
        Some major exchanges like Binance International do not allow trading with fiat currencies, which means that the only way to hold value as dollars is by converting your crypto back to stable coins.

        1. USDT: There are several different types of stable coins, but the most popular one is called Tether tokens, or USDT, which was the first stable coin ever created. 
        This coin was originally created by an exchange site called BitFinex, and they claim that the total amount of USDT in circulation are backed by actual US dollars. 
        The reason why we say "claim", however, is because there have been several allegations against the company's transparency regarding the legitimacy of their cash reserves that back the value of USDT. 
        Regardless, USDT still remains to be the most popular stable coin with the highest market capitalization of roughly 68 billion dollars as of October 2021 with the value of one USDT coin being precisely one dollar.

        2. USDC: The USD coin, or USDC, is the second most popular stable coin with roughly 32 billion dollars in market capitalization. 
        This coin was created by Centre, which is a consortium that consists of several crypto companies like Coinbase and Circle. 
        USDC has recently made some major upgrades to their system in order to allow easier access and usages for crypto payments and transactions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        3. BUSD: The Binance USD coin, or BUSD, is the third most popular stable coin with roughly 13 billion dollars in market capitalization. 
        As you can tell by its name, this coin was created and is managed by Binance, which is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. 
        This stable coin is useful when using the Binance exchange because it allows users to get a significant discount in trading fees when payed in BUSD.
