    <h4>Welcome to Crypto Consultant!</h4>
    <p>This is an informative website for people who wish to learn about the trending topic of 
        cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and its blockchain technology that may transform the way we use money and finance.</p>

    <h4>Why should you learn about Crypto?</h4>
    <p>The first cryptocurrency Bitcoin was originally created in 2009, and it was first used as an online gaming currency which barely had any real life monetary value. 
        However its value has exploded over the last decade and has recently caught the attention of millions of investors, companies, and even governments from around the world. 
        The total market capitalization of all the cryptocurrencies combined is now valued at over 2 trillion dollars! 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Although there are still many individuals and institutions who oppose the use of cryptocurrency, there is no doubt that it has the potential to completely change the world of money and finance in the near future. 
        One could argue that Bitcoin has already changed the way people use money in places like El Salvador where Bitcoin recently became legal tender for the first time in history. 
        Whether you support or oppose the cryptocurrencies, I personally believe it will be important to understand and be up to date about the emerging industry of block chain technology. 
        So, go ahead and explore this website in order to learn about the basics of crypto and feel free to leave comments or questions through our Contact Us page!
