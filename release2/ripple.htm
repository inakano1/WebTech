        The Ripple coin was launched in 2013 by Ripple Labs as their network currency for RippleNet. 
        This coin is unlike other cryptocurrencies because it does not mine, use proof-of-work, or proof-of-stake to maintain its network. 
        Instead, the network relies on selected nodes and consensus mechanism to validate the transaction ledgers. 
        Ripple has received criticism because of its somewhat centralized network system. 
        Ripple has historically been in the top positions of cryptocurrency rankings, however they have lost market share due to their recent conflics with SEC lawsuits. 
        The market capitalization of Ripple is roughly 52 billion dollars as of October 2021, with one XRP trading at around 1.12 dollars. 
        The most recent Ripple chart is listed below (from coinmarketcap.com):
