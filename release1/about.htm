    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>Fourth year undergraduate student at Babson College</p>
    <p>Originally from Japan, grew up in the United States</p>
    <p>Crypto enthusiast and investor</p>
    <p>I was first aware of Bitcoin back in 2017 because my college roommate mentioned that he had purchased some. 
        My initial reaction was immediate dismissal of Bitcoin, because I assumed that it was some sort of pyramid scheme, and that no digital money should be trusted. 
        However at the end of 2020, I begun hearing more and more about the explosion in Bitcoin prices, and that early investors were making millions of dollars.
        This caught my attention. As I researched about cryptocurrencies, I realized that this is a highly rewarding investment and that this blockchain technology could
        be the future of money. So, I started investing immediately and learned more about the crypto industry over the last year. I believe that crypto prices will keep rising 
        over the upcoming years, even though there will be crashes along the way. I hope to learn more about crypto and potentially be involved in the industry as a career in the future.
