    <h4>Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        Exchanges are used to purchase, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies by most investors and traders. 
        Because there are numerous exchanges that are popular already, it can be challenging to decide which one to use when you begin investing. 
        Here are some of the most popular and trusted crypto exchanges that you could use:

        Binance: The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange originally founded in Hong Kong, and currently based in the Cayman Islands. 
        Binance is an established company with a large client base, so it is one of the more trusted crypto echanges.  
        This exchange is known for its low trading fees and a large selection of coins. I personally use Binance to trade for these reasons. 
        However, the main Binance exchange is not available in the U.S., which means that American customers have to use Binance.us, which has less coin selections and increased restrictions. 
    </p>
    <img id="coinbase" src="coinbase.jpg" alt="image" class="center">
    <p>
        Coinbase: Largest U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange. Coinbase is a reputable company due to its security and insurance of the users' coins in the event of a hack, which is common in the crypto industry. 
        This exchange has over 50 cryptocurrencies and is easy to use for begginers. 
        However, the trading fees are relatively high compared to other exchanges like Binance, with up to 4.5 percent per transaction. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Other notable exchanges: Kraken, Crypto.com, Gemini. 
        Please note that certain exchanges may not be available to use depending on which country you are in.
